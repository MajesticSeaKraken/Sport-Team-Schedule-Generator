# Sport Team Schedule Generator

This program creates a schedule for sports teams. You identify how many teams, how many weeks, and you can select either round robin or double round robin for the scheduling format. Round Robin means that every team plays every other team in the league once, Double Round Robin means teams play every other team, on the road and at home. You type in the number of teams, the number of weeks in the season, the schedule type, and then generate the schedule. You can review the schedule once it has generated, and you can export the data - the data will show up in a tkinter text box so you can copy/paste that data whenever you need to.
